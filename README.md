# Machine Learning

I learned Python and machine learning mostly following instrtuctions and YouTube videos by  [Harrison Kinsley](https://pythonprogramming.net/). Below are some of the project highlights.

## Neural network - Pytorch

+ Dataset: MNIST
+ Modules: Matplotlib
+ [Code in Jupiter Notebook](https://github.com/nirajan-mandal/Machine_Learning/blob/main/3_MNIST.ipynb)

## Convolutional neural network - Pytorch

+ Dataset: Kaggle cats and dogs
+ Modules: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
+ [Code in Jupiter Notebook](https://github.com/nirajan-mandal/Machine_Learning/blob/main/5_cats_dogs.ipynb)
+ Results from my slow CPU

Batch, Epoch | Training time (min) | Iteration/s | Loss | Accuracy
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
10, 1 | 35 | 1 | 0.247 | 0.52
100, 1 | 25 | 7 | 0.250 | 0.52
100, 3 | 60 (20min/Epoch) | 6 | 0.109 | 0.75
100, 15 | 300 (20min/Epoch) | 5 | 0.024 | 0.76

## Cars data set - TensorFlow.js

Learning to use TensorFlow.js using the cars data set. The results are hosted [here](https://nirajan-mandal.github.io/Car_DataSet/). 

This project was implemented learning tutorial from [Google Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-regression/index.html#0)
