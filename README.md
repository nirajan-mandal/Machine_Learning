# Machine Learning

I learned Python and machine learning mostly following instrtuctions and YouTube videos by  [Harrison Kinsley](https://pythonprogramming.net/). Below are some of the project highlights.

## Neural network - Pytorch

Fully connected neural network with feed forward and using MNIST data set.

## Convolutional neural network - Pytorch

+ Dataset: Kaggle cats and dogs
+ Modules: OpenCV, numPy
